### 001_directories.yaml
The clowdhaus/terraform-composite-actions/directories action will return a list of directories that contain a versions.tf, 
where the presence of a versions.tf file is loosely representative of a Terraform project root directory. 
This is useful for running a set of commands in each Terraform root directory under a given project.
